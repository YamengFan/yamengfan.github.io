excerpt: 'Do politics drive the rise of market power in the United States? This paper studies the effect of corporate political connections with congressional committee members on market power in the US. For identification, we exploit a congressional procedure (committee exile) that leads to quasi-exogenous variations in a committee member's political influence, and thus in a firm's political connections with committees. We find that, on average, 10% more successful political connections to incumbent committee members increased firm-level markups by 1.09 percentage points for US public firms. The key mechanism is the exemption of increasing costs associated with regulatory burdens, rather than government procurement contracts. Overtime, we observe an increase in political connections among large firms. For sectors with larger increases in the concentration of political power, measured by HHI of political connections or total political expenditures, their market concentration also increased more. Overall, our results reveal political connections as a source of market power and distorted competition.'
