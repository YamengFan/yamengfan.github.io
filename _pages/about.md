Welcome to my website! I am an assistant professor of Economics at ENSAI-CREST, France. Before that, I was a PhD candidate in economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Before my doctoral study, I received my bachelor in Peking University and master in Barcelona School of Economics.
My research interests include the macroeconomics of labor markets, political economy, market power and spatial economics.
